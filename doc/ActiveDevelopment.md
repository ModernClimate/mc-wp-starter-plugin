### Repo

Setup a symlink/alias to the repo in your `wp-content/plugins` directory. This will allow you to make changes to the plugin and see them reflected in the site.

Here is an example:
`ln -s /Users/username/Sites/mc-wp-starter-plugin /Users/username/Sites/your-site/wp-content/plugins/mc-wp-starter-plugin`
or
`ln -s /Users/username/Sites/mc-wp-starter-plugin /Users/username/Sites/your-site/app/plugins/mc-wp-starter-plugin`

This will create a symlink to the repo in your plugins directory.
